Yahtzee Readme...
------------------------------------------------------------

  Hello whoever you are that downloaded this project.  Although
there are alot more things you can do with VB, I made this program
a while back and decided to update it a little and give it out
to the public.  Although it's not very hard to make, it is a good
start for a new programmer to look though. It is coded fairly well
although I am sure you will find mistakes and things you could make
better.  If you do make something better, please email it to me at
the following address:  sharmon@microtechcomputers.com , thanks.

  Every line of code was started and finished by me except the help
class file, in which I am unfamiliar with the newer Microsoft Help
format.  In the help file proj directory you will find the help
I made for the program, it was my first attempt at a MS .chm help
file.  I included it in the project so that everyone else like me
that knows nothing about a .chm help file can learn what little I
now know about it.

  Yahtzee is owned by Milton Bradley, so this game is not a sellable
item, but it is kinda fun if you like Yahtzee.  Use it for personal
use and to learn from if you don't already know everything in it's
source code.  It was made with VB6 SP3.  It has not been tested on
anything other than VB6 SP3, Win98, and Win98 SE.  Other than those
items, I am unsure of compatibility.  I will test future versions and
am adding network support and skin's to the next version.  If anyone
want's to help work on a silly little Yahtzee game, just email at
the above stated email address.

  Ok the reason why I made this is because my son was addicted to the
game for a short period (7 year old).  And playing it with him got
me interested in it.  All the rules are by the Milton Bradley rule
guide that comes with the board game.  Before I made it I searched the internet
for a game to d/l.  I found one (in which I modeled the way this one
looks like - sorry can't remember the name - it didn't come with source
code and didn't have all the correct features of the game or anyway to
undo your last score selection) so I decided then to make it.  It took
about a two days.  Anyhow here it is, have fun if you're interested.

  If you do decide to use this code, play by the rules, I wrote it, so give
me credit if you use it, do not just write your name on it and give it out
to everyone as your own game.  Thanks to all the great people who share
their code at Planet Source Code (http://www.planet-source-code.com), I have
learned more from everyone here than any schooling or books will ever teach me.
Well except api, which I had to learn most from books:)  Alhough, I will
never understand why so many people post the same code over and over there.

  Take care, Shannon Harmon - sharmon@microtechcomputers.com

PS..if you are still reading this, I don't know why.  And if you don't
like the code, sorry, don't use it.
